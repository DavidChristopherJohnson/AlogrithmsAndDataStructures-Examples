//===============================================================
// Example: Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum
// ==============================================================

// 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
//      Write a function that adds one number to another

// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
//      - Consider data types
//      - What about nulls/undefines?
//      - What about more than two numbers

// 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
//      - Consider data type

// 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?

// 5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem
//       - Name of function
//       - Name of inputs
//       - Name of output
